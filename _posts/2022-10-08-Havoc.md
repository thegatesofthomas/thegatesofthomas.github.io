## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Havoc C2 Framework Demo</span>**
Hello, I just wanted to demo the newly released Havoc framework. I didnt mention in the video but I find it very funny he named the versions after the Anime Jojo's Bizzare Adventure Stands. Sorry for the lack of content I recently got a new job and I also got sick for a bit but I should be back on track. Thank you for watching this.
