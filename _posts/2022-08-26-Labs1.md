## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Practical Malware Analysis Labs</span>**
Hello I am just drawing attention to my github where I will be uploading all the labs I am doing in a book I recently purchased called Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software 1st Edition by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski. I have completed the first set of labs which was on PE headers mainly.

[Lab 1 Writeup](https://github.com/thegatesofthomas/PracticalMalwareAnalysisAnswers/blob/bb9056a2dc8b4f66099194f4bf80327bfb1f1d2c/Lab1/Lab1Writeup.md)

## **<span style='color:#ff5555'>Where have I been?</span>**

Hello! Its been a bit I meant to upload more but I recently got a job as a Security Analyst at ReliaQuest so I have been training for that job a lot and things have been a bit hectic(in a good way). Now that things are starting to slow down I have a little bit of time to do my malware analysis and will be doing more. Thank you for the patience.
