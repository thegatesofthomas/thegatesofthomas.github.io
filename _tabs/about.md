## About Me
![Desktop View](/assets/img/me.png){: width="400" height="100" }

 -Hello welcome to my blog. My name is Thomas and I am a 21 year old cybersecurity/IT student who specializes in Malware Analysis. I have an AS(Associate's of Science) in Cybersecurity from Union County College aswell as a CompTIA Security+ certification. I am currently working on my BS in Computer Science or Information Technology(still deciding) at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. 
## About Website
I used Jekyll, an open source static site generator that runs on ruby, to make this website. I was going to just use bbootstrap but I found the way to incorporate posts to be less effcient. I also saw other blogs that were using the theme I picked for this blog and I found them to be more asethetically pleasing as well as more catered to what I was going for. What is cool about Jekyll is that it requires minimal HTML, CSS, and JS(Which I do know how to use) so I can spend more time on making posts instead of messing with the langauge of the site. This site will be used to host my malware analysis write ups/videos as well as coding projects I work on. I also may do a few blogs for cyberstuff such as hackathons, conventions, internships, and more.
